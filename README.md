<h3> Myrmidon </h3>

This is really just a proof of concept of a game in my mind that I am attempting to do with Phaser.js. If you are really interested in setting it up then

<ul> 
	<li> Make sure that node.js is installed</li>
	<li> Run npm install on command line in Myrmidon folder</li>
	<li> Run node server.js on command line in Myrmidon folder</li>
	<li> Using your browser, go to localhost:8080 and it should run </li>
</ul>
Tested in Windows 7 on Firefox and in Ubuntu in Firefox. It should work on other systems as well because it runs using Phaser.js
